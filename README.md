# scrollodex -- The scrollodex CMS

Scrollodex is a web-based system for maintaining a static
website that lists professionals (doctors, plumbers, therapists,
etc.).

The raw data is stored in YAML files in a git repository (rather
than using a database system like MySQL).

An interactive web-based "admin portal" permits easy editing and
updates.

This data is used to generate input to a Hugo-based static website.
